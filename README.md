## Lab Four

We have been looking at functions for the last two days and their relation between different strings, objects, and parameters. I'm learning most of this from scratch, so it started quite difficult. But as I've come to understand the different operators that can make up a function, I've found myself coming up with different, albeit 'unusual' solutions to solve different problems.

It helps that I was peer coding with Shinn, as he pays much closer attention to minor details than I do. I've found myself going off on tangents, and because of that, I end up finding complicated solutions to relatively easy problems -- that doesn't reflect well into what I've been taught, so it was helpful to have someone that stuck to what they knew and only 'drew outside the lines' when we both couldn't come up with a solution.

For example, we were having a bit of trouble with our third JS Function activity. In which we couldn’t convert our array back into a string. Of course, we did manage to fix this, but only by doing research into other operators. I certainly had fun testing and coming up with new solutions. But when those didn’t work we talked about what the problem may have been and did some more research.

Overall, the last two lessons have been very fun and engaging. I’ve learned quite a lot through peer coding, simply through discovering new things, and trial and error. Especially trial and error.
